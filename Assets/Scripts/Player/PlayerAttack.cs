// This script handles the player's ability to attack. The biggest responcibility of this script is to maintain the timing of attack cooldowns
// so that the player cannot attack too fast. Mostly, this is a "pass through" or "bridge" script, which means that it receives input from
// the PlayerInput scripts and then passes the input along to the appropriate attack. Very little attack logic (apart from timing) exists in this 
// script.
