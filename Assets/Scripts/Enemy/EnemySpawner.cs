//This script controls the spawning of enemies. The enemy spawner is a "pooled" spawner. A "pool" is effectively a collection of objects
//that are generally disabled. Then when they are needed, an object is enabled, used, and then disabled again when it is done. This is in
//contrast to a system where we intantiate and destroy objects when we need them and need to get rid of them. Instantiating and destroying 
//can cause lag as well as memory spikes which are both bad things. This script also has a maximum number of enemies it can spawn to prevent
//the scene from being flooded with enemies which makes the game very difficult and can cause lag / crashes.
